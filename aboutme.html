    <p>Besides maths, I have many interests: most of my free time I enjoy it reading or playing games. Lately, webcomics and manhwas are the things I am reading the most. 
        Related to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/isalimac/" target="_blank">videogames</a>, I am a consistent Genshin Impact and Stardew Valley player. My goal at the moment is 
        finishing the games I already own on Steam before getting new ones (very hard goal tbh). 
        I also truly enjoy playing multiplayer videogames and board games with friends :D </p>

      <p><img src="/photo_2023-10-02_20-26-16.jpg" alt="blanket" style="float:right;height:300px">From time to time I also like crafts. 
          Crocheting is my favourite one though. Last year I crocheted a few hats and right now I am finishing my first cardigan! Hopefully it will turn out
          great. In the right you can see an old project, which was a huge blanket made out of triangles. I am very proud that I actually finished it (but
          now is in possession of my mom, since it was too heavy to bring it to the UK).</p>

      <p><img src="/photo_2023-10-02_20-26-06.jpg" alt="blanket" style="float:left;height:300px">During my undergrad, I was actively participating in communities at my university. 
        We had the "Happiness" community, which organised fun events during the year,
      like a costume day around Halloween and a fun hat day usually in April. A picture of my Mabel (Gravity Falls) costume is at the left! I also participated in the Choir of the 
      faculty, where I was a Soprano. You can see us singing online during the lockdowns <a href="https://youtu.be/2GklcUJXAz4?si=dG4k4hIzo-nnGe7j" target="_blank">here!</a> Now in the UK, I 
      have tried new activities, for example going to dance classes, which I really enjoy (but definitely won't post on here since it's still too embarrassing).</p>

      <p>Anyways, if you want to talk about graphs or other fun things, please drop me an email and I will get back to you :)</p>
